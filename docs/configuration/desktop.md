  "meshtastic_port": 4403,
  "web_port": 8080,
  "auto_start": false,
  "session_secret": "auto-generated-secret",
  "setup_completed": true,
  "enable_virtual_node": false,
  "virtual_node_allow_admin": false
}
```

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `meshtastic_ip` | IP address of your Meshtastic node | `192.168.1.100` |
| `meshtastic_port` | TCP port for Meshtastic API | `4403` |
| `web_port` | Local port for web UI | `8080` |
| `auto_start` | Start with Windows/macOS | `false` |
| `session_secret` | Secret key for session cookies | Auto-generated |
| `setup_completed` | Whether initial setup is done | `true` after setup |
| `enable_virtual_node` | Enable virtual node server for mobile app connections | `false` |
| `virtual_node_allow_admin` | Allow admin commands via virtual node connections | `false` |

### Changing Configuration

1. Right-click (Windows) or click (macOS) the tray/menu bar icon
2. Select "Settings"
3. Update the configuration
4. Click "Save" - the backend will automatically restart

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced use cases, you can configure additional options by editing the configuration file directly or setting environment variables before launching.

### Remote Access (ALLOWED_ORIGINS)

By default, MeshMonitor Desktop only accepts connections from `localhost`. To enable access from other devices on your network:

::: warning Security Notice
Enabling remote access exposes MeshMonitor to your local network. Ensure you're on a trusted network and consider enabling authentication in MeshMonitor settings.
:::

1. Stop MeshMonitor (Quit from tray/menu bar)
2. Edit `config.json` and add an `allowed_origins` field (this requires a custom launcher script)
3. Or, create a launcher script that sets environment variables:

::: tabs

@tab Windows (PowerShell)

Create a file called `start-meshmonitor.ps1`:
```powershell
$env:ALLOWED_ORIGINS = "http://localhost:8080,http://192.168.1.50:8080"
Start-Process "C:\Program Files\MeshMonitor\MeshMonitor.exe"
```

@tab macOS (Shell)

Create a file called `start-meshmonitor.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:8080,http://192.168.1.50:8080"
open -a MeshMonitor
```
Make it executable: `chmod +x start-meshmonitor.sh`

:::

Replace `192.168.1.50` with your computer's local IP address.

### Authentication & Cookies

MeshMonitor Desktop uses secure session cookies for authentication. The session secret is automatically generated on first run and stored in your config file.

**To reset your session secret:**
1. Stop MeshMonitor
2. Edit `config.json`
3. Delete the `session_secret` line (a new one will be generated)
4. Restart MeshMonitor

::: tip
Resetting the session secret will log out all active sessions, including browser sessions that may be open.
:::

### HTTPS / SSL

The desktop application runs HTTP only (no HTTPS). This is generally fine for local use since traffic stays on your machine. For secure remote access, consider:

1. Using the Docker deployment behind a reverse proxy with SSL
2. Setting up a local VPN to access your desktop remotely
3. Using SSH port forwarding

### Environment Variables

You can set these environment variables before launching MeshMonitor to override default behavior:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | Web server port | `8081` |
| `MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP` | Meshtastic device IP | `192.168.1.100` |
| `MESHTASTIC_TCP_PORT` | Meshtastic TCP port | `4403` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed origins | `http://localhost:8080` |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | Custom database location | `/path/to/meshmonitor.db` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Custom session secret | `your-secret-key` |

> **4.0 note:** Virtual Node is now configured per source through the Dashboard UI. The `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_NODE` / `VIRTUAL_NODE_PORT` / `VIRTUAL_NODE_ALLOW_ADMIN_COMMANDS` environment variables have been removed.

### Virtual Node Server

The Virtual Node feature allows the official Meshtastic mobile apps (iOS/Android) to connect to MeshMonitor instead of directly to your Meshtastic device. This enables:

- Multiple mobile apps to view the mesh network simultaneously
- Mobile access when your Meshtastic device only supports one connection
- Access to the full message history stored in MeshMonitor

**To enable Virtual Node:**

1. Stop MeshMonitor (Quit from tray/menu bar)
2. Edit your `config.json` file
3. Set `"enable_virtual_node": true`
4. Optionally set `"virtual_node_allow_admin": true` to allow admin commands
5. Restart MeshMonitor

The virtual node server listens on port **4404** by default. In your Meshtastic mobile app, add a new TCP connection pointing to your computer's IP address and port 4404.

::: warning Security Notice
Enabling `virtual_node_allow_admin` allows mobile apps connected via the virtual node to send admin commands to your Meshtastic device. Only enable this on trusted networks.
:::

## Data Management
